# About me
---
Hi, my name is Derek Alexander I am a programming tutor at NorthWest vista alamo college. I have a degree in Game design with a focus on programming. I have experience with C#, C++, Java and python. If you want to see more there is a link to my resume at the bottom of this page. 
Some info about my me: I participate in game jams regularly and I learning new skills like: [ring making](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/RingMaking.md), [computer building](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/computerBuilding.md), 3d printing and [wood working](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/woodWorking.md). I will probably dabble into many more things later on. My goal is to develop games at a small, tight knit company.

## [Isle of Magmies](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/Unity-Games/blob/master/GameSim2019/gamesim.md) This project was from my final semester course in my degree for Game programming. In a team of 14 we made a designed and created a game in unity in one semester. The team was made up of all the game design degrees at the college: artist, 3d modeling, production, audio, and programming. I was one of two programmers on the team.

## [global game jam 2019: Mocho Fix!](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/mocho-fix-9) Mocho Fix! was my first game jam game I ever did. It was with 2 other artist over the span of 48 hours. The game is a 2D platformer for mobile. The game was submitted to the global game jam 2019. We recieved third place at our local site.

## [GGS game jam 2020: Keep 'em Seperated](https://dereka.itch.io/keep-em-separated) Keep 'em Seperated was a fully remote game jam I did with another programmer for our local game dev community, the Greater Gaming Society of San Antonio. We recieved second place in this week long game jam.
  
## [Arkanoid clone](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/C-PlusPlus/blob/master/BreakOut.cpp) Arkanoid clone was the first big project I had ever done. In a team of four programmers we made a game engine in C++ and created the 1980s game Arkanoid to demonstate the engine. The class was more stuctured like a software development enviorment than like a class. We could choose to fire eachother if the team agreed they were not carrying their weight. As well as the professor was more our boss in which he told us what he wanted and guided us but did not ever directly tell us how to do it. And not doing your work was not a grade point off but a hinderence to our team and the project itself.
