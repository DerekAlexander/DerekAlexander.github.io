# About me
---
I like trying new things like: [ring making](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/RingMaking.md), [computer building](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/computerBuilding.md), 3d printing and [wood working](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/woodWorking.md). I will probably dabble into many more things later on. I graduated at NWV college getting a degree in Game Design Programming. I goal is to develop games at a small, tight knit company.
