# about me
---
I like trying out new things like: [ring making](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/ringMaking.md), [computer building](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/computerBuilding.md), 3d printing and [wood working](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/woodWorking.md).  And probably many more things later on. Currently I am a student at NWV college getting a degree in Game design Programming. My hope is to end up doing game design at a small tight knit company.
