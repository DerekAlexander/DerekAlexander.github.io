## [global game jam 2019: Mocho Fix!](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/mocho-fix-9) 
### Mocho Fix! was my first game jam game I ever did. It was with 2 other artist over the span of 48 hours. The game is a 2D platformer for mobile in which the main the player follows and plays as the main character Mocho who runs a business where he fixes peoples strange problems, or tries to fix the problem. The game was submitted to the global game jam 2019. We recieved third place at our local site.
### tech used and systems made:
#### Dialog System
#### AI
#### Cut scene tools for artists
#### persistent item collection
#### Pixel Perfect Unity package
#### Cinemachine Unity package

## [GGS game jam 2020: Keep 'em Seperated](https://dereka.itch.io/keep-em-separated) 
### Keep 'em Seperated was a fully remote game jam I did with another programmer for our local game dev community, the Greater Gaming Society of San Antonio. The game was a 3D top down game where the player keeps the four seperated npcs from collecting, building, and traveling to a central island. This is done with different god powers like lightning, fire, and tornadoes. We recieved second place in this week long game jam.
### tech used and systems made:
#### AI system
#### Audio system
#### Menu system
#### Level design
#### Light Weight Rendering Pipeline unity package

## [Isle of Magmies](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/Unity-Games/blob/master/GameSim2019/gamesim.md)
### This project was from my final semester course in my degree for Game programming. In a team of 14 we designed and created a game in unity over the course of one semester. The team was made up of all the game design degrees at the college: artist, 3d modeling, production, audio, and programming. The game was a creature rasing game inspired by the Sonic's series chao care system. The player could play with, feed, evolve, and compete with the different creatures they raised. in this project I was one of two programmers on the team. While working on the AI and other core systems I also was responsible for the handling: shaders and overall graphical fideilty of the game, day / night cycle, import and implementation of artists assets, and competition system.
### tech used and systems made:
#### AI systems
#### Menu systems
#### competition systems
#### day / night cycle system
#### Cinemachine unity package
#### High Definition Render Pipeline preview unity package
#### Shadergraph unity package

## [Arkanoid clone](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/C-PlusPlus/blob/master/BreakOut.cpp)
### Arkanoid clone was the first big project I had ever done. In a team of four programmers we made a game engine in C++ and created the 1980s game Arkanoid to demonstate the engine. The class was more stuctured like a software development enviorment than like a class. We could choose to fire eachother if the team agreed they were not carrying their weight. As well as the professor was more our boss in which he told us what he wanted and guided us but did not ever directly tell us how to do it. And not doing your work was not a grade point off but a hinderence to our team and the project itself.
### tech used and systems made:
#### *all systems were collaborative no one person made any system*
#### collision between 2d round and rectangles
#### Rendering graphics to window
#### directx9 implementation
#### power up systems
#### ball physics system
#### text based level design
#### Audio system using FMod
