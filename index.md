# About me
---
### Hi, my name is Derek Alexander I am a VR software developer at XALTER. I have experience with Unity Engine, Unreal, C#, C++ and Java. If you want to see more there is a link to my resume at the bottom of this page. 

### My goal is to develop games at a small company where I can make something I can enjoy.

I like learning new skills like: 

[ring making](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/RingMaking.md)

[computer building](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/computerBuilding.md)

[wood working](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/DerekAlexander.github.io/blob/master/woodWorking.md)

I will probably dabble into many more things later on.

## Targa Meter Prover VR
Targa Resources asked us to create a VR simulation of their prover 7 station. The app simulated all the valves and gas flow dynamics of the actual station. Targa's purpose of this app was to train their employees on goood practices and dangers of having their gases mix in a safe and cost efficient VR training. I was one of three who created this project.

## [210 metaversity app](https://210plaza.com/)
This app was designed for the city of San Antonio, Texas to bring in tourism. The app was developed to be played on web for both pc and mobile devices. The app was a small enviroment reminiscent of the city of San Antonio that had videos from local celebrities and interactions for tourist to get excited to visit San Antonio for. Some of the unique system of this project were: loading / opening youtube videos, playing music / linking to spotify, displaying PDFs. I was one of two working on this project.

## [Metaversity VR](https://vimeo.com/819549307)
This was a year long project for Oklahoma state University Insitute of Technology. For OSUIT we created a hub world for students and teachers to meet up and play through different learning modules we previously created. Parts of this project I was responsible for were: loading previous modules through Addressables, voice chat functionality, Avatar system and UI.

## [Engine VR](https://vimeo.com/768739035)
The goal of this project was to teach students of OSUIT how to disassemble a cummings disel engine. I was project lead for this module over the 3 months of its timeline.

## [Electrical VR](https://vimeo.com/871625712)
This module for OSUIT was to recreate their insturmentation training for their intro students. Some of the requirements for this project were: Creating a semi realistic eletrical system, Implementing a troubleshooting section and manipulating a spline asset to work with our needs. 

## Oklahoma Dept of Commerce touch screen app
This project was an interactive map of Oklahoma where all the information is loaded through excel and google drive. Any number of videos, images, pdfs or POIs could be designed and loaded without rebuilding the app. I was one of two developers building this app over the course of 4 months.

## Cyber security escape room VR
This was the first module for OSUIT that EPIC Games awarded them a grant to create using Unreal Engine. The goal of this project was to teach OSUITs cyber security intro students basic data safety through a fun instructional escape room experience. Since our studio, and I, used Unity almost exclusively I created all the core VR system: simple object interactions,scenario system, UI interactions, Animations, VR Rigs, etc.

## USAF Osprey VR
For the United States Air Force we created a series of scenarios to teach their techs how to remove the tire off an Osprey VTOL safely following their instrutional manuals. I created the project over the course of few months. This was also the first project I worked on and being only the second project for the studio some of the core systems like: Grab and rotate tools, Object snapping and Guiding arrows were built in this project.

## [global game jam 2019: Mocho Fix!](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/games/mocho-fix-9)
Mocho Fix! was my first game jam game I ever did. It was with 2 other artist over the span of 48 hours. The game is a 2D platformer for mobile in which the main the player follows and plays as the main character Mocho who runs a business where he fixes peoples strange problems, or tries to fix the problem. The game was submitted to the global game jam 2019. We recieved third place at our local site.
#### tech used and systems made:
* Dialog System
* AI
* Cut scene tools for artists
* persistent item collection
* Pixel Perfect Unity package
* Cinemachine Unity package

## [GGS game jam 2020: Keep 'em Seperated](https://dereka.itch.io/keep-em-separated) 
Keep 'em Seperated was a fully remote game jam I did with another programmer for our local game dev community, the Greater Gaming Society of San Antonio. The game was a 3D top down game where the player keeps the four seperated npcs from collecting, building, and traveling to a central island. This is done with different god powers like lightning, fire, and tornadoes. We recieved second place in this week long game jam.

#### tech used and systems made:
* AI system
* Audio system
* Menu system
* Level design
* Light Weight Rendering Pipeline unity package

## [Isle of Magmies](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/Unity-Games/blob/master/GameSim2019/gamesim.md)
This project was from my final semester course in my degree for Game programming. In a team of 14 we designed and created a game in unity over the course of one semester. The team was made up of all the game design degrees at the college: artist, 3d modeling, production, audio, and programming. The game was a creature rasing game inspired by the Sonic's series chao care system. The player could play with, feed, evolve, and compete with the different creatures they raised. in this project I was one of two programmers on the team. While working on the AI and other core systems I also was responsible for the handling: shaders and overall graphical fideilty of the game, day / night cycle, import and implementation of artists assets, and competition system.

#### tech used and systems made:
 * AI systems
 * Menu systems
 * Competition systems
 * Day / night cycle system
 * Cinemachine unity package
 * High Definition Render Pipeline preview unity package
 * Shadergraph unity package

## [Arkanoid clone](https://github.com/DerekAlexander/C-PlusPlus/blob/master/BreakOut.cpp)
Arkanoid clone was the first big project I had ever done. In a team of four programmers we made a game engine in C++ and created the 1980s game Arkanoid to demonstate the engine. The class was more stuctured like a software development enviorment than like a class. We could choose to fire eachother if the team agreed they were not carrying their weight. As well as the professor was more our boss in which he told us what he wanted and guided us but did not ever directly tell us how to do it. And not doing your work was not a grade point off but a hinderence to our team and the project itself.

#### tech used and systems made:
 * collision between 2d round and rectangles
 * Rendering graphics to window
 * directx9 implementation
 * power up systems
 * ball physics system
 * text based level design
 * Audio system using FMod
